Config:
-------

### Change the MAC address (Line 106) to the one you see when connecting the board to Bluetooth

### At lines 30 and 31 change the resolution to the one of your display

### Change line 42 to the refresh rate you currently have

### Lines 143-145 have the player configurations, change the images and names to what you want.

Audio:
------

### For audio, please add the following files in the same directory as the game: main\_intro.wav, transition.wav, connection\_main.wav, connection\_intro.wav, and main\_loop.wav

### Note: The files that start with "main" are used on the main game screen (NOT the connection screen). The files that start with "connection" are used on the connection screen. The file with the word "transition" is used during the transition between the connection and "main game" screens.
